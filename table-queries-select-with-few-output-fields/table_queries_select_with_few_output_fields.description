// Ballerina allows users select specific fields from a table using query syntax similar to SQL. In this example, the
// public profiles of people is selected (i.e Only the name and the age is selected) and return a table of public
// profiles. This query syntax can only be used to query a table. Modification of an existing table is not supported.
// When an existing table is queried using Ballerina SQL, a new in-memory table is created with the queried data and
// that table is returned. Executing these SQL-like queries on tables returned through Ballerina database clients is not
// supported yet.
