// Ballerina supports joining two tables along with filters in queries similar to SQL. In this particular example, two
// tables, one with persons' details and other table with order details are joined together. Both tables have the person
// id which is used to join. From the first table, the person with name 'Jane' is filtered out and from the other table
// the order details entry of which the personId is three, is filtered out. This query syntax can only be used
// to query a table. Modification of an existing table is not supported When an existing table is queried using
// Ballerina SQL, a new in-memory table is created with the queried data and that table is returned. Executing these
// SQL-like queries on tables returned through Ballerina database clients is not supported yet.
