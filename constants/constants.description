// Constants are values known during the compile time. As of now, only value-type constants (i.e., constants of `boolean`, `byte`,
// `decimal`, `float`, `int`, and `string` types) are supported. Constants are useful for defining enumeration types.
//
// These constants can be used just like any other value-type variable except the value of these constants cannot be
// changed after initializing. The difference between the final variables and constants is that the value of the final
// variables can be initialized during the runtime. However, constants must be initialized during the compile time.
