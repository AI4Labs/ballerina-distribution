// The union types are types whose set of values is the union of the value spaces of its component types.
// For example, you can use a variable of a union type to store a `string` or an `int`,
// but there is only one value at any given time.
// Syntactically, you can define a union type with component types separated by "|" (vertical bar).
// If () is in the value space of a union type, then the implicit initial value for the union type is ();
// otherwise the union type does not have an implicit initial value.
