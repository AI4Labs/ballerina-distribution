// The `any` type is the root of the Ballerina types. It can represent a variable of any type excluding error type.
// `any` is an union type which consists
// anydata | object | function pointers | stream | channel | service types.
// When you do not have prior knowledge of the type of your variable, you can assign `any` as the type.
// Values of these variables can come from dynamic content such as the request and response message references and
// Ballerina reference variable types. The `any` type allows you to skip compile-time type checks.
