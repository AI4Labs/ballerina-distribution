// This example demonstrates how to use the JDBC client with DDL and DML operations.
//Please note that, the MySQL database driver jar should be placed under `BALLERINA_HOME/bre/lib`.
//The MySQL connector uses some database properties from MySQL version 8.0.x onwards, therefore it is
//encouraged to use MySQL driver version greater than 8.0.x.
