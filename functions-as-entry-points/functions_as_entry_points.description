// Any `public` function could be an entry point to a Ballerina program. The function to consider as the entry point
// could be specified with the `ballerina run` command, and if no function is specified, the function name defaults to
// `main`.
// These functions would be data-binding and could have zero or more parameters of any supported type, including any
// number of required/defaultable parameters and/or a single rest parameter.
// They may also return a value which could be printed to the standard out stream by setting the `--printreturn` option
// with the `run` command.
