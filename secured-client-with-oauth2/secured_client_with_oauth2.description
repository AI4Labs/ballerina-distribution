// A secured client with oauth2 authentication is used to connect to a
// secured service with oauth2 authentication. An additional `auth`
// field is added to the HTTP client endpoint initialization in order
// to make the simple HTTP client endpoint into a secure client endpoint.
// Inside the `auth` filed the `scheme`, `accessToken`, `clientId`,
// `clientSecret`, `refreshToken` and `refreshUrl` is defined for
// OAuth2 authentication.
