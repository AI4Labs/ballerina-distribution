// A `Person` record is attached to the Scheduler when attaching the service.
// It is then passed into the resource functions of the service.
// When the `age` of the `person` reaches the `maxAge`, an error is returned.
// The global variable `exitLoop` used to track the error, and cancel the
// `Scheduler`, when an error is returned.
# To run this sample, navigate to the directory that contains the
# `.bal` file and issue the `ballerina run` command.
