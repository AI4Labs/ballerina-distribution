// One of the design principals of Ballerina's type system is to eliminate null reference error.
// Over the years, null reference errors have caused numerous system crashes, security vulnerabilities, etc.
// Optional types in Ballerina allows developers identify places where the value or function
// is of type T optionally for any T. You can syntactically represent this as T? or T|().
