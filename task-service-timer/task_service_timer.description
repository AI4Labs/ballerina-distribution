// Task Timer Services are used to execute tasks periodically. A timer should have
// an `interval` specified, and an `initialDelay` if needed. The delay
// specifies the initial delay before the task is executed for the first time.
// Thereafter, the timer triggers at the provided interval. A `onTrigger()`
// resource is called when the timer triggers. If a failure occurs during the
// execution of the `onTrigger()` resource function, it returns an error, which
// is passed to the 'onError()' resource function.
