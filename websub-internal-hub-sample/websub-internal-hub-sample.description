// Ballerina provides the capability to easily introduce WebSub compliant publishers and subscribers.
// Ballerina WebSub subscribers can specify the topic they wish to subscribe to and the hub they wish to subscribe at
// to receive notifications, and the subscription process would be initiated at start up if specified. Signature
// validation is performed by default for subscribers receiving authenticated content. Ballerina WebSub Subscriber
// Services could thus be registered as webhooks to receive event notifications.
// Ballerina also comes with an in-built WebSub Hub service which can be brought up by publishers who require bringing
// up a hub.
// This sample demonstrates a WebSub Publisher, which brings up an internal hub and publishes updates to it, and a
// WebSub Subscriber, which subscribes at the publisher's hub to receive notifications for the publisher's topic.
