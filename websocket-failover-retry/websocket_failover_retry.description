// Ballerina users can configure multiple backend in a given failover config. If the WebSocket client lost the connection due to server goes down or getting any IOExceptions, Ballerina automatically try to connect with remaining backend that is specified in the configuration only once. If above scenario fails, Ballerina automatically reconnect with all specified endpoints until connection made success or maximum reconnect attempts.
