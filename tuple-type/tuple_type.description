// A tuple is a fixed length, immutable, list of two or more values.
// A tuple type is described by specifying the type for each member of the list.
// A tuple type has an implicit initial value if all the member types have an implicit default value,
// then the implicit initial value for the tuple type is the tuple of those implicit initial values;
// otherwise, the tuple type does not have an implicit initial value.
