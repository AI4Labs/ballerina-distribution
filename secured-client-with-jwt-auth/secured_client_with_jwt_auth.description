// A secured client with jwt authentication is used to connect to a
// secured service with jwt authentication. An additional `auth`
// field is added to the HTTP client endpoint initialization in order
// to make the simple HTTP client endpoint into a secure client endpoint.
// Inside the `auth` filed the `scheme` is defined for JWT authentication.
