# To run this sample, create a new TOML file with name `configuration.toml` in the
# same directory of the `.bal` file.

# The TOML must contain the following,
#
# hostName = "192.0.1.2"
# port = 9090
# enableRemote = false
# maxPayload = 0.321

# The TOML file must include the module information in the following TOML table
# format, for running the sample in a ballerina project.

# [organizationName.packageName.submoduleName]
# variable-name = value

# Then, navigate to the directory that contains the `.bal` and
# `configuration.toml` files, and execute the `ballerina run` command below.

ballerina run configurable.bal

# The output will be as follows:
Service created successfully with the configuration,
host : 192.0.1.2
