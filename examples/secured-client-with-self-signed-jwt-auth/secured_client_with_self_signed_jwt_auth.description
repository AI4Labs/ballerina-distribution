// A client, which is secured with self signed JWT auth can be used to connect
// to a service, which is secured with JWT auth.
// The HTTP is enriched with `Authorization` header by passing the record of
// JWT issuer configurations for `auth` configuration of the client. The
// signature of the JWT is a self signed signature at the time of issuing.
// <br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see the [JWT module](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/api-docs/ballerina/#/ballerina/jwt/latest/jwt/).
