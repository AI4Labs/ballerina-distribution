// Ballerina supports Observability out of the box, and Tracing is one of the three important aspects of 
// Observability. To observe Ballerina code, the build time flag `--observability-included` and the runtime flag
// `--b7a.observability.tracing.enabled=true` should be given when starting the service.
// The developers can trace their code blocks and measure the time incurred during the actual runtime execution.
// They can choose to hook their measurement with the default trace created or can create a completely new trace.<br/><br/>
// For more information, see [How to Observe Ballerina Services](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/how-to-observe-ballerina-code/).
