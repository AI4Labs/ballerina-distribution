// `join` clause can be used to perform an inner equijoin on iterables using `query expression`.
// It starts with `join` which behaves similarly to `from` clause, iterating any iterable value.
// Then, an `on` condition is defined with `equals` keyword to compare the values and identify
// the matching items based on the given condition. The iteration skips following the clauses
// for the non-matching items which dissatisfy the `on` condition.
