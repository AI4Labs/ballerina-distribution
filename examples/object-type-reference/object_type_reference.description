// Object type references provide a way to copy the members from an object 
// into another object. It is equivalent to specifying the members explicitly
// within the new object, thus, eliminating redundancy. An object can have
// zero or more type references and may have chained references as well.
// Fields and method definitions can override referenced fields and methods
// provided that they are sub-types of referenced field/method types.
