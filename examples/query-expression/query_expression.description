// A `query expression` is a list comprehension, which can be used with a value that is iterable with any error type.
// It consists of following clauses: `from`, `join`, `let`, `on`, `where`, `select`, and `limit`.
// The first clause must be a `from` clause and must have a `select` clause as well.
// The result of the query expression is a list.
