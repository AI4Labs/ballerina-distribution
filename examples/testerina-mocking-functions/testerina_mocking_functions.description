// Mock functions allow you to hide the real functions and engage your own functions when running tests.
// This allows you to isolate your test functions from the rest. Both mocking an imported function and a
// function declared in the module under test can be mocked with dedicated annotations.<br/><br/>
// Mocking an imported function will apply the mocked function to every instance of the original function call.
// It is not limited to the test file where it is being mocked. Mocking a function from the module under test
// can be scoped to have different behaviors for different test cases.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see [The Test Module](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/api-docs/ballerina/test/index.html).
