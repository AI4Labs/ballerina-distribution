// Mock functions allow you to hide the real functions and engage your own functions when running tests.
// This allows you to isolate your tests from other modules. Function mocks can be stubbed with return
// values or with a user-defined function which has the same signature as the real function.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see [The Test Module](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/api-docs/ballerina/test/index.html).
