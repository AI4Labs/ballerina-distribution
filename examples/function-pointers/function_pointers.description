// Ballerina allows the user to define variables of function types. This allows you to use
// functions in similar contexts as other values. For example, as variables, arguments to
// functions, and return values of functions. The name of a function serves as a reference
// to that function when it is used in an expression context. The type of a function
// is given by the signature of the function.
