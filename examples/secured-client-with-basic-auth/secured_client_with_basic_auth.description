// A client, which is secured with Basic auth can be used to connect to a
// service, which is secured with Basic auth.
// The HTTP is enriched with `Authorization` header by passing the record of
// `username` and `password` for `auth` configuration of the client.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [Auth module](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/api-docs/ballerina/#/ballerina/auth/latest/auth/).
