// Ballerina supports Observability out of the box and Metrics is one of the three important aspects of 
// Observability. To observe Ballerina code, the build time flag `--observability-included` and the runtime flag
// `--b7a.observability.metrics.enabled=true` should be given when starting the service.
// You can define and use metrics to measure your own logic. A counter is one type of the metrics that is
// supported by default in Ballerina, and it is a cumulative metric that represents a single monotonically increasing
// counter whose value can only increase or be reset to zero.<br/><br/>
// For more information, see [How to Observe Ballerina Services](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/how-to-observe-ballerina-code/).
