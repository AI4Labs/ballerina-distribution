// This example shows how to send a JMS message, consumed by the JMS listener service,
// to an HTTP endpoint. A text payload from the JMS broker is expected and that payload is then
// forwarded to an HTTP endpoint.
// If you don't have already setup a JMS message broker, you can get the Ballerina message broker
// from [github](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-message-broker/releases) or get the
// [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ballerina/message-broker/).
