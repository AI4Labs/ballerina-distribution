//Tables and steams can be joined using streaming query logic.
//In this example, orders coming from customers for a certain item is checked against the stock table to varify
//whether there are enough stock to deliver the order. An alert is triggered if the stock is not sufficient.
//Ballerina Streams is an experimental feature. Please use `--experimental` flag when compiling Ballerina files
//which have streaming constructs.
