// Please note that, the relevant database driver jar
//should be placed under `BALLERINA_HOME/bre/lib` folder. The sample below is based on 
//H2 database, and the H2 database driver jar is included default into Ballerina distribution, 
//therefore it is not required to copy the driver jar for H2 database.
