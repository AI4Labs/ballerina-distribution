// This example demonstrates how to initialize the JDBC client with different
//initialization options. Please note that, the relevant database driver jar
//should be placed under `BALLERINA_HOME/bre/lib` folder. However, this sample is based on
//H2 database, and the H2 database driver jar is included by default into Ballerina distribution,
//therefore it is not required to copy the driver jar for H2 database.
