// `checkpanic` is a unary expression that is used to handle errors.
// The checkpanic expression checks the result of the sub-expression and panics the program if the result is error.
// Hence, checkpanic can be considered as a built-in type-guard for errors, where if resulted in an error,
// the program will panic.
