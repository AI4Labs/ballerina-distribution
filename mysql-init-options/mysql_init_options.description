// This example demonstrates how to initialize the MySQL client with different
//initialization options. Please note that, the MySQL database driver jar
//should be placed under `BALLERINA_HOME/bre/lib`. The MySQL connector uses some database properties
//from MySQL version 8.0.x onwards, therefore it is encouraged to use MySQL driver version greater than 8.0.x.
