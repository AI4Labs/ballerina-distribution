// This example demonstrates how to use the JDBC client with complex data types such as arrays,
// binary, blobs, clob, and date/time fields.
// Please note that, the relevant database driver jar
//should be placed under `BALLERINA_HOME/bre/lib` folder. However this sample is based on
//H2 database and the H2 database driver JAR is included by default in the Ballerina distribution.
//Therefore, it is not required to copy the driver JAR for the H2 database.
