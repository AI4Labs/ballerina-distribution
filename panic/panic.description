// In Ballerina, panic indicates abnormal completions, and usually implies something unexpected has occured
// (something that should not have occurred during the normal operation). A panic causes
// the call stack to be unwound until a matching catcher is found.

// Ballerina encourages developers NOT to use `panic` to handle program related
// errors such as `header not found`, `data mismatched` errors, etc.). However, 
// `Connection Closed/Timeout` and `OutOfMemory` errors can be used in an error situation 
// where the program cannot handle the error by itself.
