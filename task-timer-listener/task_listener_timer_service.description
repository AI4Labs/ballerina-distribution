// Task Timer Services are used to execute tasks periodically. A timer may have
// an initial delay and interval specified. The delay specifies the delay
// between registering the task service and its first execution. Thereafter,
// the timer goes off at regular intervals. A onTrigger resource is called when
// the timer goes off. If a failure occurs during the execution of the onTrigger
// resource function, it returns an error, which is passed to the 'onError()'
// resource function.
