//XML to JSON conversion can be done using the 'toJSON' function. This function 
//takes the XML to be converted and struct of options as arguments. The options
//struct has two fields. The first is attributePrefix, which is the prefix to
//add to the key to identify an XML attribute and namespaces where the default
//value is '@'. The second is preserveNamespaces and is used to indicate whether 
//to preserve namespace prefixes when converting or not.
