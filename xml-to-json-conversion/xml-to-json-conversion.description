//XML to JSON conversion can be done using the 'toJSON' function. This function 
//takes the XML to be converted and struct of options as arguments. The options
//struct has two fields. The first is attributePrefix, which is the prefix used
//to add to the key that identifies an XML attribute and namespaces where the
//default value is '@'. The second is preserveNamespaces and is used to indicate 
//whether to preserve namespace prefixes when converting or not.
