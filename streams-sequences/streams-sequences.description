// Sequence is a state machine implementation that detect the sequence of event occurrences over time.
// Here all matching events need to arrive consecutively to match the sequence condition, and there cannot be any
// non-matching events arriving within a matching sequence of events. This can correlate events within a single stream
// or between multiple streams. In this example, the above fact is used to detect the peaks in the temperature
// variation. Idea is that, if the temperature is always increasing (incoming events have always higher temperature
// reading than the previous event's reading) and then decreasing (incoming events have always lower temperature reading
// than the previous event's temperature reading), we have a peak temperature in the middle.
