// A secured client with Basic authentication is used to connect to a secured
// service with Basic authentication.
// The `auth:OutboundBasicAuthProvider` is initialized with `username` and
// `password` and the `http:BasicAuthHeaderHandler` is initialized by providing
// the created `auth:OutboundBasicAuthProvider`. An additional `auth` field is
// added to the HTTP  client endpoint initialization in order to make the
// simple HTTP client endpoint into a secure client endpoint. Inside the `auth`
// field the field `authHandler` is defined as the created
// `http:BasicAuthHeaderHandler`.
